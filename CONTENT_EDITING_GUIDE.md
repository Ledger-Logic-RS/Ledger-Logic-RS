# Content Editing Guide for BizLand Website

## Overview

## Important Notes

### 1. JSON Syntax
- Always use double quotes `"` for text
- Separate items with commas `,`
- Don't forget closing braces `}` and brackets `]`
- Be careful with special characters - use `\"` for quotes within text

### 2. Icons
For icons, use Bootstrap Icons classes:
- `bi-activity` for activity icon
- `bi-people` for people icon
- `bi-geo-alt` for location icon
- See full list at: https://icons.getbootstrap.com/

### 3. Images
- Keep image paths as they are unless you're replacing images
- Image paths should be relative to the website root
- Example: `assets/img/team/team-1.jpg`

### 4. Links
- Use `#` for internal page links (like `#about`)
- Use full URLs for external links (like `https://example.com`)
